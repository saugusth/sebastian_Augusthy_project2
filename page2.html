<h1>Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI)</h1>
<p>Children ages one to three are generally affected with Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI). My sister Sarah suffers from this impairment after coming out of a coma at two weeks old.</p> 
<p>CVI originates in the occipital lobe (back part of the brain) and not the eye.</p>

<p>Children with CVI are not able to visually fixate and their response to stimulation such as light may be poor. Since the occipital lobe is impaired, people who have CVI cannot perceive the world around them. For example, if you see an orange ball with black stripes, you know it must be a basketball because you perceived it. For people with CVI, they would see the same orange ball with black stripes but will not be able to understand that it was a basketball because they could not perceive it.</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) is caused by damage to the gray matter, white matter or both in the occipital cortex. In my sister's case, it was caused by low oxygen at birth.</p>
